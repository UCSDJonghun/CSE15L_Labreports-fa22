## Part 2

I took around 1 minute and 28 seconds to edit the file, scp and run the in the remote server.

I took around 1 minuite to edit the file and run in the remote server.
  
* Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?
  
I prefre editing the task in vim becasue It is faster than visual studio code and scp it. 
  
* What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)
  
I prefer using visual studio code when my task need to edit or replace many lines of the code, but I prefer vim when I need edit or replace a few lines of the code.
